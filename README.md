This extension provides linting for C/C++ files.

Linting information is obtained from the use for these optional tools:
* Compiler (gcc, clang)
* Clang-Tidy
* CppCheck

Each tool can be configured separately. Please check extension contributions section for options.

The extension expects the project to provide a `compile_commands.json` file in an appropriate format.
